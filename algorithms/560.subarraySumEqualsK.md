## Solution 
Python3
```python3
# by awice@github

def subarraySum(self, A, K):
    count = collections.Counter()
    count[0] = 1
    ans = su = 0
    for x in A:
        su += x
        ans += count[su-K]
        count[su] += 1
    return ans
```
## Points
* [i, j] -> [0, j] - [0, i-1]
* collections.Counter instead of Normal dict. Reason: if x does not exit in the Counters, Counter[x] == 0 but dict[x] would cause error
