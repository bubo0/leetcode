classSolution:
    def subarraySum(self, A, K):
        count = collections.Counter()
        count[0] = 1
        ans = su = 0
        for x in A:
            su += x
            ans += count[su-K]
            count[su] += 1
        return ans
```
## Complexity: O(n) (one loop)
## Points
* [i, j] -> [0, j] - [0, i-1]
* **collections.Counter** instead of Normal dict. Reason: if x does not exit in the Counters, Counter[x] == 0 but dict[x] would cause error
